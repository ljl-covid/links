# Questions

**First and foremost**: Please [read this article](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca) and understand what is happening, and about to happen again. This virus is not a joke, and let's get one thing straight: it's definitely **NOT** a flu. [It is not even very bad flu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ljl-covid/links/master/images/flu-vs-covid-mortality.png):

* it is a completely different type of virus (the [coronavirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus) dubbed [SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2), while influenza is caused by an [influenzavirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae))
* it has a much longer incubation time, during which evidence is starting to accumulate that it can very well be transmissible
* it may be [more easily transmissible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number) than even some of the very bad flus
* mortality rates are [higher than regular seasonal flus](https://rpubs.com/tonynick/covidinfoecd) and if they are allowed to spike, they may [dwarf death figures from all causes](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/imgLib/20200414_CovidweeklydeathsNYv3.jpg) (graphs from [The New Atlantis](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/not-like-the-flu-not-like-car-crashes-not-like))
* the mortality profile is [quite different](https://github.com/mbevand/covid19-age-stratified-ifr) from seasonal flu, with the sick and elderly being disproportionately at risk, and some [similarities only arise with the hugely lethal "Spanish" flu pandemic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220305117)
* many people (roughly 15% to 30%) require hospitalization, putting strain on resources that risks driving up COVID-19 and all-cause mortality during critical shortages
* about 5% to 10% develop a very serious *viral* pneumonia, while people developing pneumonia from influenza usually develop a more treatable *bacterial* pneumonia
* while there are now some vaccines available, the effort to scale them to cover the entire population is enormous, and for now the majority of people don't have access to them
* we have no immune defenses against it currently, while we have varying degree of immune response to influenza, depending on the strain we're seeing

But it does tend to present with fever, joint aches and a dry cough. Right, those are similar symptoms to flu. They are also symptoms of a myriad other diseases too, so there is no reason in particular to compare it with flu. Bottom line: it has nothing to do with the flu except for having some similar symptoms just like most other viral diseases.

## Do I have it ?

Short answer: we don't know.

A very important thing about this disease is having tests, because this disease cannot be [diagnosed clinically](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/clinical_diagnosis), meaning that even a doctor won't be able to tell you whether or not you have it just based on looking at you and checking out your symptoms.

This is because COVID-19 can be considered a [flu-like illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza-like_illness): this doesn't mean it has actually anything to do with flu (see the [relevant section]()!), but merely that it causes symptoms that are extremely generic and common to many illnesses, such as fever and cough.

So if you have some symptoms, unfortunately, it needs to be clear that you *cannot* determine wether or not it's COVID-19 on your own, or even with others' help, or even with a doctor's help, without a test. On the other hand, there are signs and symptoms that indicate you should probably *call* a doctor (don't go to one, call them first!) on the suspicion you may have COVID-19, or simply because they are concerning enough.

You can read and follow [this self-triage tool](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/20/self-triage-tool-covid-19/) to determine whether your symptoms warrant consulting medical services.

[ProPublica requests information sharing](https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/we-want-to-talk-to-people-working-or-living-on-the-front-lines-of-coronavirus-help-us-report) from people who have been affected by the virus (as patients, caregivers or health workers). If you are or have been a patient, please feel free to write there.

## Why is WHO information confusing?

The [WHO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization) is more of a political body than a scientific information body. They will say what their member states and their committees think will make people behave in desired ways, not necessarily state the exact scientific truth, or that we don't know it yet. This can explain why they seemed to be against wearing masks while there was a shortage of them for healthcare workers.

When the WHO says "there is no evidence" for something, that's exactly what they are saying: "there is no \[sufficient\] evidence for it", not "it isn't true"; often their information seems to imply something isn't true when there merely hasn't been extremely solid evidence accumulated yet to corroborate it.

Note that the WHO will generally be unable to make statements that their more prominent member states do not want them to make, even if those statements would be scientifically valid, which [has been admitted by WHO representatives](https://github.com/ljl-covid/links/blob/0bc2e2e50ef46b1852ca5e4197d4a94b4019dbfe/speeches/Italian-Civil-Protection/2020-04-15.txt#L89) themselves.

## Masks

There is mixed advice on the use of masks by the general public, and the advice from political authorities appears to be changing in various parts of the world depending on the availability of masks and the state of the pandemic. Here are some scientific articles or papers trying to determine the usefulness of masks, and behaviors such as re-use of masks.

* [Face Masks for the General Public](https://rs-delve.github.io/reports/2020/05/04/face-masks-for-the-general-public.html) by the [Royal Society DELVE initiative](https://rs-delve.github.io/), answering many basic question on mask use, making, re-use, cleaning and appropriateness backed by a number of references

* [Community Use of Cloth Masks to Control the Spread of SARS-CoV-2](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html/) is a document by the CDC describing the espected benefits of mask wearing, especially multi-layered cloth masks for community use
